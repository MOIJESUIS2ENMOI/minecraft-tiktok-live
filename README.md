# Minecraft-TikTok Live Interaction Script

## Description

The Minecraft-TikTok Live Interaction script is an innovative solution that enables real-time interaction between the Minecraft universe and live broadcasts on TikTok. With this unique integration, viewers can send gifts and trigger specific actions in the Minecraft world during live streams, making the broadcasting experience even more immersive and interactive.

## How It Works

The script operates simply and efficiently. When a viewer sends a gift during a live TikTok broadcast, the script detects the action and automatically triggers a series of predefined events in Minecraft. These events can range from generating special structures to spawning unique creatures or activating special commands. The possibilities are endless, and the experience can be fully customized based on the broadcaster's preferences.
